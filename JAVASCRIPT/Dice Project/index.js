// create random number between 1 & 6
var randomNumber1 = Math.floor((Math.random() * 5) + 1);

// Use the random number you created in the last step to pick out a random dice image between dice1.png to dice6.png then place this image inside the left <img> element.

// Hint: You will need to use what you've learnt about the DOM and the method setAttribute() to achieve this.
